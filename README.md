# DH150-Assignment02

## Purpose of the UT

#### This user testing session was conducted to test the usability of the UCLA Radio.com website.  User testing allows researchers to gain insights on user experience by conduction evaluations in a near-real world setting with real, relevant feddback. Often, reserchers will discover issues that may have been overlooked during heuristic testing, or not apparent to those who have existing familiarity with the tested website. Two of the tasks were designed to simulate the experience of a typical user: a college or college-aged person interested in the UCLA community. Another task was designed to simulate the experience of a less prominent, but still equally important demographic: that of a music promotor, or more generally, someone invovled in the music industry. The heuristic evaluation of this website revealed some major issues with the website's *aesthetic*. Also, there were as issues with information presentation of the 'Shows' and 'DJ list' pages, leading to poor *flexibility and efficiency* of use in these domains. These factors, among other, were considered in the design of this test.

## Results and Reflection

#### There were a couple issues with the user testing. A user test recording was lost due to technical difficulties, the insights learned from that session are applicable. Additionally, the internet connection was lost during the testing session. It was reestablished later - note that this brief section is ommitted in the video. Due to these complications, my patience as a moderator was challenged. Ensuring that the test is moving along while also providing neutral feedback can be difficult. Also, some of the provided instructions were a bit unclear, and required clarification. However, it was an enjoyable experience. I learned a considerable amount about both the website itself and how to better my testing methodologies.

#### Many of the issues considered in the heuristic evalutation were addressed during our testing. As our user demonstrated, navigating the show panel is tricky, requring many clicks from the user to locate information about specific shows. There are no catagories or search features for shows. Adding features such as these would have helped our user expedite the assigned tasks. The blog's search features were robust and effective, but it took a considerable amoung of time to locate the search feature itself. Critique of the website aesthetic was expressed too. The landing page is outdated and busy, as reflected by our user's feedback. However, our user did express that the website was trustworthy, and it's consistently updated and visible content (especially on the blog) was appreciated.


#### *A quick note:* on our user test that was lost, the user experienced an issue accessing the DJ page. Upon attempting to access that webpage via a click on the upper navigation bar, the loading graphic played indefinitely. This is an issue with respect to the *visibility of system status* heuristic: our user thought that the website was functioning due to the animated graphic, but it was not. Rather, the website had to be reloaded, but this caveat was not communicated to our user.


#### In the future, I will provide more explicit instructions on the survey, and strive to be more patient and empathetic towards my user. A secure wifi connection will be established to ensure there are as few glitches in the testing process as possible.
